Q:  For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
A: SJF (Shortest Job First) delivers the same turnaround times as FIFO (First In, First Out)
    when the jobs have the same length. This is because both schedulers will execute the jobs in the same order.

Q:  For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver the same response times as RR?
A:  SJF delivers the same response times as RR (Round Robin) when the quantum length is equal to or greater than
    the length of the shortest job. This is because RR will not preempt a job until its quantum expires,
    so if the quantum is long enough, SJF and RR will behave the same.

Q:  What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase?
    Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
A:  The response time with SJF increases as job lengths increase. This is because SJF always runs
    the shortest job first, so longer jobs have to wait for shorter jobs to complete.

Q:  What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase?
    Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
A:  The response time with RR increases as quantum lengths increase. This is because a longer quantum means that
    each job gets to run for a longer time before being preempted, which increases the time it takes for all jobs
    to get their first turn. The worst-case response time for RR with N jobs and a quantum length of Q is (N-1)*Q.
    This is because in the worst case, a job could be the last in the round-robin order and would have to wait for all
    other jobs to use up their quantum before getting its turn
